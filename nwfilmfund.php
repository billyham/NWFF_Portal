        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The Northwest Film Fund supports documentary film projects in the Northwest (including 
            Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Alaska) at any stage of completion. The Fund offers 
            vital support to emerging filmmakers, helping promising films transition more rapidly from 
            the planning stage to production, and providing a platform to introduce excellent new 
            documentaries into the world.
        </p>


        <!--<p>
            The submission deadline for 2013 Northwest Film Fund applications is July 26. 
        </p>-->

        <p>
            Northwest Film Forum will award at least one grant of $10,000 in cash, as well as a package 
            of artist services including legal consultation, post-production services with leading Seattle 
            post houses, and a meeting with KCTS-Channel 9.

        <p>
            Grant awards are competitive and decided by a panel of industry expert judges who review the 
            applications and make the final selections. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The Northwest Film Fund receives generous support from regional foundations and individuals, 
            many of whom supported the Documentary Pooled Fund, which was created by Humanities Washington, 
            and which awarded money to 10 documentary films from 2003 to 2005, including the award-winning 
            <span class="filmtitle">Wheedle’s Groove</span> and <span class="filmtitle">Made in China</span>. The Film Forum is proud to 
            carry on the legacy that Humanities Washington created.
        
        <p>
            
        </p>


        <h2>Eligibility</h2>
        <p>

            production or pre-production. The applicant must be a current resident of Washington State, Oregon,
