            An Artist Residency is a time for planting seeds, 
            for shaping inspiration, and going further down creative paths. In the 
            spring (May 18-20) and fall (mid-November) of 2012, the Film Forum will 
            launch the first phase of its Artist Residency program.
        </p>

        <p>
            We will host established and emerging artists for intensive 72-hour institutes 
            that include one-on-one story conferences, workshops, seminars, and mentoring 
            sessions meant to transform emerging filmmakers’ careers. Our location is a 
            grand house on nearby Orcas Island, far enough from the city to insulate 
            creativity. The concept is simple, and it is adapted from the Sundance Institute 
            model: we will invite four or five filmmakers of national (and international) 
            reputation to mentor and teach four or five regional filmmakers of emerging 
            reputation. The filmmakers we invite and select will be new voices, envelope-pushing 
            talents. Using this as a first step we will, over a couple of years, further 
            develop the three-day institutes into longer and multi-branched residencies, 
            in which artists will be invited to create new work over longer periods. These 
            future residencies will include teaching, the mentoring of younger filmmakers, 
            and film curation.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Film Forum has spent the last two years amplifying its support of regional 
            and visiting artists, including weeklong film premieres, retrospectives, master 
            classes, and short film production. In 2010, we hosted over 80 guest filmmakers, 
            including many artists we invited to stay for several days to interact with our 
            audiences and with local filmmakers.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            The selection process will include inviting applications from emerging regional 
            filmmakers, to include a script or detailed treatment and a sample reel. We will 
            allow two-person writer-director teams to participate as well.
        </p>
        
        <p>    
            One or two months following the lab we will host a follow-up Producers Lab as 
            a continuation of the mentoring, and specifically to support the development of 
            each filmmaker’s project. All participants in the lab will have the opportunity 
            to apply for grant support, including our new Northwest Film Fund.
